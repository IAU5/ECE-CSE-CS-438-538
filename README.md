## 📚 ECE 230 - DIGITAL SYSTEM

Welcome to **ECE/CSE 438/538:  EdgeAI Hardware Systems** Course. This 3-credit advanced-level course takes a hardware-centric view of AI/machine learning systems from constrained embedded devices to high-level distributed systems. It covers topics like ML design for low-power devices, optimization techniques for real-time processing, and deployment strategies for AI/ML models on embedded devices, bridging the gap between AI theory and practical hardware implementation.
